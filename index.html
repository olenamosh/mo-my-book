            <p>Decades of software testing experience condensed into the most important lessons learned.</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s leading software testing experts lend you their wisdom and years of experience to help you avoid the most common mistakes in testing software. Each lesson is an assertion related to software testing, followed by an explanation or example that shows you the how, when, and why of the testing lesson. More than just tips, tricks, and pitfalls to avoid, Lessons Learned in Software Testing speeds you through the critical testing phase of the software development project without the extensive trial and error it normally takes to do so. The ultimate resource for software testers and developers at every level of expertise, this guidebook features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Over 200 lessons gleaned from over 30 years of combined testing experience</li>
<li>Tips, tricks, and common pitfalls to avoid by simply reading the book rather than finding out the hard way</li>
<li>Lessons for all key topic areas, including test design, test management, testing strategies, and bug reporting</li>
<li>Explanations and examples of each testing trouble spot help illustrate each lesson&rsquo;s assertion</li>

<p>How to Find and Fix the Killer Software Bugs that Evade Conventional Testing</p>

<p>In Exploratory Software Testing, renowned software testing expert James Whittaker reveals the real causes of today’s most serious, well-hidden software bugs and introduces powerful new &ldquo;exploratory&rdquo; techniques for finding and correcting them.</p>

<p>Drawing on nearly two decades of experience working at the cutting edge of testing with Google, Microsoft, and other top software organizations, Whittaker introduces innovative new processes for manual testing that are repeatable, prescriptive, teachable, and extremely effective. Whittaker defines both in-the-small techniques for individual testers and in-the-large techniques to supercharge test teams. He also introduces a hybrid strategy for injecting exploratory concepts into traditional scripted testing. You’ll learn when to use each, and how to use them all successfully.</p>

<p>Concise, entertaining, and actionable, this book introduces robust techniques that have been used extensively by real testers on shipping software, illuminating their actual experiences with these techniques, and the results they’ve achieved. Writing for testers, QA specialists, developers, program managers, and architects alike, Whittaker answers crucial questions such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do some bugs remain invisible to automated testing and how can I uncover them?</li>
<li>What techniques will help me consistently discover and eliminate &ldquo;show stopper&rdquo; bugs?</li>
<li>How do I make manual testing more effective and less boring and unpleasant?</li>
<li>What’s the most effective high-level test strategy for each project?</li>
<li>Which inputs should I test when I can’t test them all?</li>
<li>Which test cases will provide the best feature coverage?</li>
</ol>
